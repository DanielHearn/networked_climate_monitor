        This project has been designed and developed by Daniel Hearn for a
        final year project at the University of Portsmouth. The source code
        and designs for this project can be found on

        To use the project the sensor nodes and base station must be setup,
        turned on and running their software. You must then register an
        account and login to this account. You can then access the climate
        data and manage sensors.
